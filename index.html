<h3>Programming Languages</h3>

<h4 id="cpp">C++</h4>
<p>
Similarly to Java, C++ is a well-established high-level programming language. However, in contrast to Java,
C++ is geared towards fine-grained control over sytem resources. For example, C++ does not have an automatic
garbage collection but requires developers to think about how they manage memory. While C++ allows for very efficient and stable
software, development is typically considerably slower than in other languages due to a lack of supporting libraries,
long compile times, and the intricacies of the language. HoweverA, if performance is a prime goal of the software,
C++ is probably the way to go. It is no coincidence that the core of <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>">Tensorflow</a>
is written in C++. While C++ is not suitable for data science tasks, it excels when engineering large-scale AI systems
for which performance is key.
</p>

<h4 id="golang">Go</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is a minimalist, compiled language that was developed by Google: <a href="https://yourbasic.org/golang/advantages-over-java-python/">it is performant, type-safe, and transparent</a>. However, there is currently <a href="https://101.datascience.community/2019/04/26/golang-for-data-science/">little support for data exploration</a>,
which means that Go is not suitable for typical data science tasks. However, <a href="https://medium.com/@calebkaiser/why-were-writing-machine-learning-infrastructure-in-go-not-python-38d6a37e2d76">Go is well-suited for infrastructure management tasks</a>, for example for model deployment.
So, while Go will probably never become a typical language data scientists will use, it should be considered for AI engineering tasks.
</p>

<h4 id="java">Java</h4>
<p>
Java has been the most widely used high-level programming language for a long time now. Due to its virtual machine,
Java applications are independent of the system architecture, rendering Java code highly portable. Java has an active
community and has great ecosystems for overall software engineering, for example, due to highly developed IDEs
that are very convenient to use. However, Java does not really support the data science process. Thus,
Java likely only plays a role if models have to be integrated into an existing Java application.
</p>

<h4 id="r">R</h4>
<p>
R is a programming language that natively supports vectorized operations. Thus, R is ideal for all applications
in which multi-dimensional data are relevant. Due to R's popularity in the statistical community,
there is a plethora of libraries for visualizing, exploring, and modeling data. Overall,
R is not as generally applicable and not as robust as other languages, which is why alternatives such as Python
should be considered for productive systems.

<h3>What is the data science tech radar?</h3>

<p>
The tech radar visualizes an evaluation of available data science technologies. The individual rings
in the radar chart indicate the evaluations of technologies. From inside to outside these categories are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are widely used and are known to excel in data science projects. If you choose these technologies,
    you are standing on solid footing. Note that it is still necessary to weigh the pros and cons of technologies depending on the specific application scenario.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are popular for some tasks in the context of AI. Selecting a technology
    from this technology is slightly riskier than choosing a technology from the ADOPT category.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Promising technologies that are still new and have potential for widespread use. Technologies in this category
    are riskier because the community still needs to gain more experiences in utilizing these technologies.</li> 
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should be avoided in new projects. A technology may be on HOLD because it has become outdated
    or because the technology is not yet sufficiently mature.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
Choosing technologies is hard. Technology choices have to be based on the specific requirements of individual projects.
Still, it is possible to provide some general guidance. For example, some technologies are not very suitable for data science
and can therefore be ruled out in most cases. Similarly, there are evergreen technologies whose application is nearly risk-free.

This visualization aims at giving you an overview of data science technologies and how they should be handled when starting out a new project.
</p>

<h3>How are the decisions made?</h3>

<p>
This data science tech radar is maintained by <a href="https://datascienceblog.net">Matthias Döring</a>.
The decisions are made based on his personal and professional experiences with the technologies.
In order to integrate the knowledge and experience from the data science community,
please get in touch if you feel that any technology is missing/misplaced. If you make a contribution,
you will of course receive an honorable mention in the acknowledgements section.

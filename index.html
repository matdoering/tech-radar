<h3>What is the data science tech radar?</h3>

<p>
The tech radar visualizes an evaluation of available data science technologies. The individual rings
in the radar chart indicate the evaluations of technologies. From inside to outside these categories are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are widely used and are known to excel in data science projects. If you choose these technologies,
    you are standing on solid footing. Note that it is still necessary to weigh the pros and cons of technologies depending on the specific application scenario.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are popular in some contexts but still have to evaluated in others. Selecting a technology
    from this technology is slightly riskier than choosing a technology from the ADOPT category.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Promising technologies that are still new and have potential for widespread use. Technologies in this category
    are riskier because the community still needs to gain more experiences in utilizing these technologies.</li> 
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should be avoided in new projects. A technology may be on HOLD because it has become outdated
    or because the technology is not yet sufficiently mature.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
Choosing technologies is hard. Technology choices have to be based on the specific requirements of individual projects.
Still, it is possible to provide some general guidance. For example, some technologies are not very suitable for data science
and can therefore be ruled out in most cases. Similarly, there are evergreen technologies whose application is nearly risk-free.

This visualization aims at giving you an overview of data science technologies and how they should be handled when starting out a new project.

<h3>How are the decisions made?</h3>

<p>
This data science tech radar is maintained by <a href="https://datascienceblog.net">Matthias DÃ¶ring</a>.
The decisions are made based on his personal and professional experiences with the technologies.
In order to integrate the knowledge and experience from the data science community,
please get in touch if you feel that any technology is missing/misplaced. If you make a contribution,
you will of course receive an honorable mention in the acknowledgements section.
